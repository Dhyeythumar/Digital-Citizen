## What is this repository
* This project is done by our team Tech Buddies for the TSEC Hackathon 2018. Our topic is Digital Citizens.


## Basic idea of the application
So basically this topic was how the user can efficiently manage the disastrous situations by using our application.

We have made an application which can provide the neccessary steps to the user at a critical time of disaster it includes the new feed based on the disaster, important contacts, map to locate the near by hospitals, fire stations, blood banks, police stations and many more.

It also contains the FAQ's, short and efficient discriptions on various disasters.
This can be seen in the ppt.
